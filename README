# CU-RULES[1]

A library for processing sensitivity analysis rules produced by Cardiff
University within the project KnoHolEM[2].

# Installation

The library builds with maven. Ensure that you have a maven installation,
e.g issuing:

  mvn -v

If this fails, follow the installation instructions on the [maven
website][2].

A jar package can be produced via:

  mvn package

It will be placed under the `target` subdirectory. You can add the jar in your
classpath manually, or alternatively, if you use maven, install it with:

  mvn install

# Using

The rule parser needs a configuration in order to work. You can make yours
by implementing `RuleParserConfiguration` or use the default one:

  RuleParser parser = new RuleParser(RuleParserConfiguration.getDefaultConfiguration());

Once you've got an SA rule string conforming with the configuration, you can
parse it like this:

  SensitivityAnalysisRule rule = parser.parseRule(ruleLiteral);

A `SensitivityAnalysisRule` can be converted to an SWRL rule via the
`SWRLConverter` interface. Similarly to the `RuleParser` it needs a
configuration instance:

  SWRLConverter converter = new SWRLConverter(SWRLConverterConfiguration.getDefaultConfiguration());
  SWRLRule swrlRule = converter.convertRule(rule);

Currently, the library does not support the manipulation of the rules' atoms.
For this and further issues, refer to the TODO document.

# Running

The jar package has a main entry point which allows you to convert the
sensitivity analysis rules and print the results on the standard output.

  java -jar target/cu-rules-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/rules...
