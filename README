# CU-RULES[1]

A library for processing sensitivity analysis rules.

# Installation

The library builds with maven. Ensure that you have a maven installation,
issuing for example:

  mvn -v

If this fails, follow the installation instructions on the [maven
website][2].

A jar package can be produced via:

  mvn package

It will be placed under the target subdirectory. You can add the jar in
your classpath manually, or alternatively, if you use maven, install it
by:

  mvn install

# Running

The jar package has a main entry point which allows you to convert the
sensitivity analysis rules and print the results on the standard output.

  java -jar target/cu-rules-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/rules
