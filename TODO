# TODO

Here's a current list of todo items, more or less ordered by priority:

 * Sanitize should check the rule format.
 * Refactor OntologySWRLConverterConfiguration (configuration based maybe?).
 * Make the parser configuration automatically configurable (based on keys). To achieve this, split the configuration in rule syntax and predicate syntax.
 * Introduce typed literals.
 * Documentation.
